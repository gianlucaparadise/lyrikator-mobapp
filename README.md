# Lyrikator

## Overview

Lyrikator is an application that lets you search songs by lyrics (using [Genius](https://genius.com/)). 
With Lyrikator you can:

* Use the search bar in the app to search lyrics
* Use the Google Assistant search saying "Ok Google, search Excuse while I kiss the sky on Lyrikator".

## Try it

### Android

Lyrikator for Android can be installed from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gianlucaparadise.lyrikator).

### iOS

Lyrikator for iOS is fully working, but it has not been published yet because I can't afford the Apple Developer License ðŸ˜¢
